# market-mix-modelling
Market Mix Modeling is a statistical technique used to analyze the effectiveness of various marketing tactics on sales. It helps in quantifying the impact of different marketing channels (such as TV, radio, online advertising, and promotions) and external factors (like seasonality and economic conditions) on sales performance.

This repository contains the code and data for a Market Mix Modelling project.
